# FrontEnd juniorCode challenge 3 - Pixel Arts

## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- Webpack
- Typescript
- HTML
- SCSS

* I'm using Webpack because it's easy to configure the project with all the dependencies, also it's really easy to add new packages for my app in case that I need it. 
* For this project I choose to use only typescript to build the functionality of my app, I like typescript because 
It is more restrictive than javascript (with the types, parameters, etc).

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project: (if none, remove the table and explain why)

Name | Reason
--- | ---
[dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image) | To generate the image from the divElement
[FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) | To save the image generated in my computer

I used these two packages to resolve my problem to generate an image from my divElement and save it in my computer,
also because it was easy to use them.

## Installation / Run
---
To run the project locally, enter the following in the command line / bash:

```console
$ git clone <linktorepository>
$ cd <repositoryname>
$ yarn install
$ yarn run start
```
